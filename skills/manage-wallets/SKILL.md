# Manage Wallets

## List wallets
Call `list_wallets`. Present results: ID, name, wallet address, master wallet address, type, network, status.

## Delete a wallet
1. If the user hasn't specified a wallet address, call `list_wallets` first and ask which one to delete.
2. Check if any agents are using this wallet. If so, warn the user and ask them to delete those agents first.
3. Confirm with the user before deleting — show the wallet name and address.
4. Call `delete_wallet` with the `walletAddress`.
5. Report results: TEE removal and trading-data removal status.
