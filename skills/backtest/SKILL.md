# Backtest Agent Strategy

Follow these steps to run a backtest.

## Step 1 — Initialize session
Call `init_trading_session` with mode `"paper"`. Handle the response:
- **keys.generated = true**: Inform the user a new Nostr identity was created.
- **access.hasAccess = false**: Ask for their wallet address, call `request_trading_access`, and tell them an admin must approve at https://agent.openswap.xyz/admin/waitlist. STOP here.

## Step 2 — Identify the agent
If the user specified an agent ID, use it. Otherwise ask the user for the agent ID. Call `get_agent` to fetch the agent details (name, strategy, capital).

## Step 3 — Set backtest parameters
Ask the user for:
- **Time range**: start and end time (ISO datetime or unix timestamp)
- **Initial capital**: or default to the agent's existing capital
- **Protocol fee** (optional): fee override
- **Gas fee** (optional): fee override

## Step 4 — Optionally override strategy
If the user wants to test a different strategy, build a new one (indicators, rules, risk_manager). For detailed schema references, see the `strategy-reference` skill. Otherwise use the agent's existing strategy.

## Step 5 — Confirm before submitting
Present a summary: agent name/ID, time range, initial capital, fees (if any), and strategy (existing or override). Ask the user to confirm before proceeding. Do NOT call `create_backtest` until the user explicitly confirms.

## Step 6 — Submit the backtest
Call `create_backtest` with agentId, initialCapital, startTime, endTime, and optional protocolFee, gasFee, strategy. Save the returned `jobId`.

## Step 7 — Poll progress and fetch results
Call `get_backtest_job` with the jobId to poll its progress and status.
- If status is **Completed**: call `get_backtest_result` with the jobId and present a summary including portfolio value, return %, win rate, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and trade count.
- If still running: inform the user of the current progress and suggest checking again later.

## Step 8 — Show backtest history
Call `get_backtests` with the agentId to list past backtests for context.
